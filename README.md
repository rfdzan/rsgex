# rsgex
Regular expression from the terminal, in Rust.
# What is it going to look like?
It's going to be a TUI. Likely with [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui).
TUI design is still underway.
# But you're also in the middle of making a regex tool in Javascript?
[Yeah](https://github.com/rfdzan/electron-regx), I wanted to try different UIs and see which feels best.
# Why Rust?
There's probably not a single language out there with better tooling for CLI tools than Rust.
